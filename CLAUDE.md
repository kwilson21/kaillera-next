# kaillera-next — Project Context for Claude

## What this project is

A website where anyone can visit a URL and play retro games (initially SSB64)
online with friends — no emulator installation required. The browser runs EmulatorJS
(mupen64plus-next WASM core); players connect via WebRTC. The server handles rooms
and WebRTC signaling only.

The long-term goal is a clean protocol that desktop clients (Mupen64Plus, future Kaillera
compat) can also speak — but v1 ships the website first.

## Guiding principles

- **Finish it.** Scope decisions should favor shipping a working prototype over
  completeness. Cut features, not corners on what ships.
- **Python everywhere possible.** The developer's primary language is Python. Minimize
  the surface area of non-Python code.
- **Web-first in v1.** Browser + EmulatorJS + WebRTC. No installation for players.
- **Desktop clients in v2.** Mupen64Plus native netplay, Kaillera compat — after the
  website works.

## Architecture

```
V1 — Browser-based

  [Browser: EmulatorJS + ROM]        [Browser: EmulatorJS + ROM]
          │   Socket.IO (signaling)          │
          └──────────────┬───────────────────┘
                         ▼
              [kaillera-next server]
              Python FastAPI + Socket.IO
              - Room management (create/join/leave)
              - WebRTC offer/answer/ICE relay
              - Game data relay (save states, input)
              HTTP/WS :27888

  Lockstep mode: all players run the emulator in sync via WebRTC DataChannels.
  Streaming mode: host runs the emulator and streams video via WebRTC MediaStream.
  Server is idle after signaling completes (lockstep) or relays save states (initial sync).

## Socket.IO events

All events go through the default Socket.IO namespace (`/`).

| Event | Direction | Payload | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `open-room` | client→server | `{extra: {sessionid, playerId, player_name, room_name, game_id}, maxPlayers}` | Create room |
| `join-room` | client→server | `{extra: {sessionid, userid, player_name, spectate}}` | Join/spectate |
| `leave-room` | client→server | `{}` | Leave room |
| `claim-slot` | client→server | `{slot}` | Spectator → player |
| `start-game` | client→server | `{mode, rollbackEnabled}` | Host starts game |
| `end-game` | client→server | `{}` | Host ends game |
| `set-name` | client→server | `{name}` | Update player display name |
| `set-mode` | client→server | `{mode}` | Host sets game mode |
| `webrtc-signal` | bidirectional | `{target, offer/answer/candidate}` | WebRTC relay |
| `rom-signal` | bidirectional | `{target, ...}` | Pre-game ROM transfer signaling |
| `data-message` | client→server→room | `{type, ...}` | Save state / late-join relay |
| `snapshot` | client→server→room | `{...}` | Game snapshot relay |
| `input` | client→server→room | `{...}` | Input relay (streaming mode) |

| `rom-ready` | client→server | `{ready}` | Player signals ROM loaded |
| `rom-declare` | client→server | `{...}` | Declare ROM file info to room |
| `input-type` | client→server | `{type}` | Player reports input type (keyboard/gamepad) |
| `device-type` | client→server | `{type}` | Player reports device type |
| `debug-sync` | client→server | `{...}` | Upload sync diagnostic log |
| `debug-logs` | client→server | `{...}` | Upload debug console log |
| `users-updated` | server→room | `{players, spectators, owner}` | Room state broadcast |
| `rom-sharing-updated` | server→room | `{romSharing}` | ROM sharing state changed |
| `game-started` | server→room | `{mode, rollbackEnabled, romHash}` | Game started |

## Key decisions

- **Stack:** Python FastAPI + python-socketio + uvloop. Server latency doesn't affect
  game performance — WebRTC is P2P once the handshake completes.
- **Lockstep netplay:** Full mesh WebRTC DataChannels. Each player runs their own
  emulator; inputs are exchanged every frame with configurable delay buffering.
- **Streaming netplay:** Star topology. Host runs the only emulator, streams canvas
  video via WebRTC MediaStream. Guests send input back over DataChannel.
- **ROM handling:** User drag-and-drops ROM file; cached in IndexedDB.
- **Rooms are ephemeral:** No persistent database. Rooms live in memory (with optional
  Redis persistence for zero-downtime deploys and reconnect survival).
- **Patched WASM core:** mupen64plus-next compiled with deterministic timing patches
  (kn_set_deterministic, kn_set_frame_time) for lockstep sync. Falls back to stock
  CDN core with JS-level timing shim.

## Dev environment

- macOS (primary dev machine)
- Python 3.11+
- `uv` or `pip install .` for dependency management
- Docker for production builds
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` env var controls CORS (default `*`, set to your domain in production)
- `PORT` (default 27888), `MAX_ROOMS` (default 100), `MAX_SPECTATORS` (default 20)
- `.env` file supported via python-dotenv
