# kaillera-next — Project Context for Claude

## What this project is

A website where anyone can visit a URL and play retro games (initially SSB64)
online with friends — no emulator installation required. The browser runs EmulatorJS
(mupen64plus-next WASM core); players connect via WebRTC. The server handles rooms
and WebRTC signaling only.

The long-term goal is a clean protocol that desktop clients (Mupen64Plus, future Kaillera
compat) can also speak — but v1 ships the website first.

## Guiding principles

- **Finish it.** Scope decisions should favor shipping a working prototype over
  completeness. Cut features, not corners on what ships.
- **Python everywhere possible.** The developer's primary language is Python. Minimize
  the surface area of non-Python code.
- **Web-first in v1.** Browser + EmulatorJS + WebRTC. No installation for players.
- **Desktop clients in v2.** Mupen64Plus native netplay, Kaillera compat — after the
  website works.

## Architecture

```
V1 — Browser-based

  [Browser: EmulatorJS + ROM]        [Browser: EmulatorJS + ROM]
          │   Socket.IO (signaling)          │
          └──────────────┬───────────────────┘
                         ▼
              [kaillera-next server]
              Python FastAPI + Socket.IO
              - Room management (create/join/leave)
              - WebRTC offer/answer/ICE relay
              - Game data relay (save states, input)
              HTTP/WS :27888

  Lockstep mode: all players run the emulator in sync via WebRTC DataChannels.
  Streaming mode: host runs the emulator and streams video via WebRTC MediaStream.
  Server is idle after signaling completes (lockstep) or relays save states (initial sync).
```

## Key decisions

- **Stack:** Python FastAPI + python-socketio + uvloop. Server latency doesn't affect
  game performance — WebRTC is P2P once the handshake completes.
- **Lockstep netplay:** Full mesh WebRTC DataChannels. Each player runs their own
  emulator; inputs are exchanged every frame with configurable delay buffering.
- **Streaming netplay:** Star topology. Host runs the only emulator, streams canvas
  video via WebRTC MediaStream. Guests send input back over DataChannel.
- **ROM handling:** User drag-and-drops ROM file; cached in IndexedDB.
- **Rooms are ephemeral:** No persistent database. Rooms live in memory (with optional
  Redis persistence for zero-downtime deploys and reconnect survival).
- **Patched WASM core:** mupen64plus-next compiled with deterministic timing patches
  (kn_set_deterministic, kn_set_frame_time) for lockstep sync. Falls back to stock
  CDN core with JS-level timing shim.

## Netplay invariants

Two codified invariants govern the netplay tick loop. See
[docs/netplay-invariants.md](docs/netplay-invariants.md):

- **I1 — No stall without a timeout:** every tick-loop early-return that
  waits on external events has a wall-clock deadline and a recovery
  action. Every deadline site is listed in the invariants doc.
- **I2 — Reconnect starts clean:** all per-peer cleanup routes through
  `resetPeerState(slot, reason)`. Adding per-peer state without updating
  `resetPeerState` is a review-level violation.
- **Rollback integrity** (R1-R6): the C rollback engine must produce
  bit-correct state or fail loudly. Dev builds throw on violation;
  production logs `REPLAY-NORUN`, `RB-INVARIANT-VIOLATION`,
  `FATAL-RING-STALE`, or `RB-LIVE-MISMATCH`. No mid-match auto-resync
  from these events — fix the root cause instead. See
  [docs/netplay-invariants.md §Rollback Integrity](docs/netplay-invariants.md).

A detection-only tick watchdog (MF6) logs `TICK-STUCK` for any residual
stall past I1/I2. **It takes no recovery action by design** — its only
job is to surface bugs we haven't found yet. Auto-recovery was
considered and rejected; see the rejected-alternatives section in the
invariants doc before proposing any watchdog that *acts* on stalls.

## Versioning

- **Auto-versioning** via post-commit hook (`scripts/bump-version.sh`)
- Commit messages use **conventional commits**: `feat:` → minor bump, `fix:` → patch bump, anything else → no bump
- Only runs on the `main` branch
- Version displayed in page footer (`web/static/version.json`), changelog in modal (`web/static/changelog.json`)
- PRs are squash-merged; PR title becomes the commit message

## Dev environment

- macOS (primary dev machine)
- Python 3.11+
- `uv` or `pip install .` for dependency management
- Docker for production builds
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` env var controls CORS (default `*`, set to your domain in production)
- `PORT` (default 27888), `MAX_ROOMS` (default 100), `MAX_SPECTATORS` (default 20)
- `.env` file supported via python-dotenv
